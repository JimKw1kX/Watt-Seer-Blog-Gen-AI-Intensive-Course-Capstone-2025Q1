# âš¡ Watt-Saver

This Capstone Project is part of the **5-day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google**, which took place from **Monday, March 31 â€“ Friday, April 4, 2025**.  
Participants collaborated on applying Generative AI to the problem of understanding and optimizing residential energy consumption using real-world and simulated datasets.

## ðŸ“– How It Came to Be

The idea for Watt-Seer began when **Suresh Srinivas** posted a note in the Kaggle Discord during the Gen AI Intensive Course, inviting participants to explore AI-powered approaches to home energy efficiency.

The response was overwhelming â€” over **28 participants** signed up within 24 hours.

To support everyone, Suresh mentored and guided participants in **self-organizing into four collaborative teams**, based on shared interests and skillsets.

In two kickoff Zoom sessions, participants introduced themselves, shared goals, and aligned on project themes. From there, teams began collaborating daily using **Kaggle Notebooks, Discord channels, and Zoom coworking sessions** â€” all centered around the Watt-Seer initiative.

The result: a showcase of whatâ€™s possible when community, data, and Gen AI come together to solve real-world problems.
